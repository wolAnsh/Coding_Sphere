# Coding_Sphere

Hey, Everyone! 🚀

Welcome to **Coding_Sphere**, a platform designed to help competitive programmers and developers debug their C++ code efficiently! 💡

## 🌟 What is Coding_Sphere?
Coding_Sphere is a web-based tool that allows you to enter two C++ programs and automatically generate test cases to find the first input for which the outputs of both programs differ. This is extremely useful when debugging and trying to identify failing test cases in competitive programming

## 🎯 Why Did I Create This?
We all struggle to find that one tricky test case where our code fails while the correct solution works. Instead of manually checking, let **Coding_Sphere** do the hard work for you! 💻✨

## 🔥 Features:
- 📝 Input two C++ codes.
- 🔢 Define the number of test cases and input range.
- 🔍 Automatically generates test cases.
- ⚡ Finds the first failing test case where outputs mismatch.
- 🎯 Helps in debugging and improving logic.

## 🚀 How It Works:
1. Paste your **first C++ code** (your solution).
2. Paste your **second C++ code** (expected solution or brute force approach).
3. Define the **number of test cases** and **input range**.
4. Click **Compare** and let the tool find the first failing test case!

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Code Execution API**: JDoodle / Sphere Engine

## 🛠️ Work In Progress
This project is under development! Stay tuned for updates. 🚧

💙 **Contributions and feedback are welcome!** Let’s build something awesome together. ✨
